# Design Patterns

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. They are formalised best practices, templates that a programmer can use to solve common problems.

## Repository structure

This repository is a collection of most common design patterns in various languages. Each pattern is given a directory with:

  - a simple README that describes the pattern in greater details;
  - one self-contained implementation per language in the following format: <br>
    `[language-name].[language-extension]`

## Patterns overview

A list of languages implementations and patterns included in this repository is by no means set. It merely reflects my interests and requirements.

The following patterns are included:

- [**Template**](./template) – for optimising identical code that does exactly the same thing except in one place, where sometimes it wants to do one thing, sometimes another.

- [**Strategy**](./strategy) – blah

- [**Observer**](./observer) – for when we have Class A that needs to know what happens in Class B, or for when Class A needs to react to changes in class B.
